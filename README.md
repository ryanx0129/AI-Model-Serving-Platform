# 🧠 AI Model Serving Platform (Amazon Ring AI-Aligned MVP)

A production-grade platform for uploading, versioning, serving, and monitoring machine learning models in real-time — designed to mirror cloud-scale ML infrastructure such as that used by Amazon Ring.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📦 **Model Upload & Versioning** – Upload and manage multiple ML models (NLP/vision) dynamically.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Inference API** – FastAPI-based scalable endpoint for inference serving.
- 📊 **Live Monitoring** – Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for latency, throughput, and system metrics.
- 🔁 **Hot-Swapping Models** – Dynamically load/unload models without downtime.
- ☁️ **Kubernetes Scaling** – Fully containerized, scalable with HPA on resource usage.
- 🔐 **Secure Deployments** – Environment config, secrets management, CI/CD workflows.
